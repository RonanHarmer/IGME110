        <p>This is intended as a video to warn people (specifically children) about the potential dangers of lava, and that it is not to be played with. I used videos depicting lava being poured into multiple substances, such as water, mustard, maple syrup, and corn syrup, to show its effects on everyday food items. I also included the music in the background to create a sense of unease, and discourage the viewer from wanting to play with lava even further. As someone who has lost too many friends, family, and food products to lava-related accidents, this was a very personal project for me.</p>
