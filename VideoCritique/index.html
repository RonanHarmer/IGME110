        <p>My original video advertisement</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The advertisement was designed to create a sense of tension in the viewer to further the point that lava is dangerous and should not be messed with. The music I included was used to help create that atmosphere, and the videos I used were to show its effects firsthand.</li>
            <li>The critique process helped me design an advertisement that drove the point home better, and also helped with some technical improvements to the sound quality of the video.</li>
            <li>Critique notes:</li>
            <li>- Put the end text on a pure black background and make the text white</li>
            <li>- Make sure that the viewer can hear the sound effects I added</li>
        </ul>
